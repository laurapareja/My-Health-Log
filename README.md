# My Health Log Project

This is going to be a long project where I'm going to use all of my knowledge as a front-end developer. During Adalab's course, I had the idea to create this app, firstly as a way to keep learning, but little by little, this project has been growing as you can see.

The idea is to have an app where you can see all of the info related to your health. It  can be usefull for you, to put some alarms to remember when you need to take the next medication, or for your doctor who can see quickly your health status. You can register your medication, flare-ups, symptomps, so It's easier to transmit all of this info to your doctor.
